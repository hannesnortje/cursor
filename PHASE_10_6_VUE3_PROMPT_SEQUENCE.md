# Phase 10.6: Vue 3 TypeScript Production Project Test - Complete Prompt Sequence

**Project**: Production-Ready Vue 3 TypeScript Application (Requirements Discovered via PDCA)  
**Methodology**: PDCA Framework + Agile/Scrum + Coordinator-First Architecture  
**Testing Focus**: End-to-End AI Agent System Validation  
**Dual Cursor Setup**: Development Cursor (MCP Server) + Management Cursor (Natural Language)  

## **🔧 FIXES APPLIED (September 9, 2025)**

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Natural Language Interface**: Users can now talk directly to Coordinator Agent without MCP tool syntax
2. ✅ **Conversation Flow**: Coordinator Agent now properly progresses through PDCA phases
3. ✅ **Agent Creation**: Coordinator Agent can now create specialized agents when requested
4. ✅ **PDCA Integration**: PDCA planning now uses actual Coordinator Agent instead of hardcoded responses

**How to Use:**
- **Direct Natural Language**: Simply type your message directly (no "Use chat_with_coordinator" needed)
- **Progressive Planning**: Coordinator will guide you through PDCA framework step by step
- **Agent Creation**: When ready, ask Coordinator to create specialized agents
- **Full Integration**: All agents work together with proper coordination

---

## **Project Overview**

This document contains the complete sequence of natural language prompts to test our AI agent system's ability to handle a realistic production project from start to finish. The test follows a **Coordinator-First Architecture** where:

1. **Initial State**: Coordinator knows nothing about the project
2. **PDCA Discovery**: Coordinator uses Plan-Do-Check-Act framework to discover requirements
3. **Agile/Scrum Planning**: Coordinator delegates to Agile Agent for sprint planning
4. **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinator creates and manages specialized agents
5. **Development Execution**: Agents work collaboratively with full visibility
6. **Dashboard Monitoring**: Real-time agent activity monitoring
7. **Direct Agent Interaction**: Direct collaboration with UI development agent

**Key Test Features:**
- **PDCA Framework**: Systematic requirement discovery and project planning
- **Coordinator-First**: Single point of communication that orchestrates everything
- **Agile/Scrum Integration**: Complete sprint planning and execution lifecycle
- **Cross-Agent Visibility**: All agent work visible through Coordinator and Dashboard
- **Realistic Workflow**: Production-ready project with proper methodology
- **Dual Cursor Setup**: Development environment + Management interface
- **Bug Tracking**: Real-time identification and resolution of system issues

### **Test Architecture**

**Development Cursor (MCP Server Connected):**
- Project folder where AI Agent System operates
- MCP server running with all agents
- Real-time agent collaboration
- Dashboard monitoring agent activity

**Management Cursor (Natural Language Interface):**
- This cursor where prompts are given
- No MCP server connection
- Natural language communication
- Progress tracking and issue identification

### **Expected Project Discovery Process**

The coordinator will discover through PDCA framework:
1. **Project Type**: Web application (discovered through questioning)
2. **Technology Stack**: Vue 3 + TypeScript (discovered through requirements)
3. **Features**: Admin panel, authentication, user management (discovered through needs)
4. **Architecture**: Frontend + Backend + Database (discovered through complexity)
5. **Deployment**: Docker + CI/CD (discovered through production requirements)

## **Prompt Sequence**

### **Phase 1: PDCA Framework - Project Discovery and Planning**

#### **Chat 1: Initial Project Request (Coordinator Agent)**

```
Use chat_with_coordinator with message="I want to start a new project. I have a business need that requires a software solution, but I'm not sure exactly what technology stack or approach would be best. Can you help me figure out what we need to build and how to approach it? I'd like to use your PDCA framework to make sure we plan this properly before we start development. What information do you need from me to get started?"
```

**Expected Coordinator Response:**
- Coordinator should ask clarifying questions about business needs
- Should not assume any technology stack
- Should use PDCA framework to discover requirements
- Should ask about business context, users, goals, constraints

#### **Chat 2: Business Requirements Discovery (Coordinator Agent)**

```
Use chat_with_coordinator with message="Based on your questions, here's what I can tell you:

**Business Context:**
- Small company with about 50 employees
- Currently using spreadsheets and manual processes for user management
- Need a centralized system for managing employee accounts and basic company metrics
- Budget is limited but we need something production-ready
- Timeline is flexible but we want to move fast

**Current Pain Points:**
- No centralized user management
- Manual processes for onboarding/offboarding employees
- No visibility into basic company metrics
- Inconsistent data across different systems
- Time-consuming administrative tasks

**Goals:**
- Streamline user management processes
- Provide visibility into basic company metrics
- Reduce administrative overhead
- Improve data consistency
- Make the system accessible to non-technical users

**Constraints:**
- Must be web-based (employees work remotely)
- Should work on mobile devices
- Need to be secure (employee data)
- Should be easy to maintain and update
- Cost-effective solution

What do you think we should build? What questions do you have about the requirements?"
```

**Expected Coordinator Response:**
- Should analyze the business context
- Should identify that this is a web application need
- Should ask about specific features and functionality
- Should start thinking about technology requirements
- Should propose next steps in PDCA process

#### **Chat 3: Technical Requirements Discovery (Coordinator Agent)**

Use chat_with_coordinator with message="Based on our discussion, I think we need a web-based admin panel. Here are some specific requirements I've identified:

**Core Features Needed:**
- User authentication and management (employees can log in)
- Admin dashboard to view company metrics
- User management (add, edit, remove employees)
- Basic settings and configuration
- Should work on desktop and mobile

**Technical Considerations:**
- Need to be fast and responsive
- Should be secure (employee data protection)
- Easy to maintain and update
- Should integrate with our existing systems eventually
- Need to be cost-effective to host

**User Roles:**
- Admin users (HR, management) - full access
- Regular employees - limited access to their own data
- Need different permission levels

**Data Requirements:**
- Employee information (name, email, department, role)
- Basic metrics (user count, activity, etc.)
- System settings and preferences

What technology approach would you recommend? What questions do you have about the technical requirements?"
```

**Expected Coordinator Response:**
- Should start identifying technology stack options
- Should ask about specific technical requirements
- Should consider frontend/backend architecture
- Should ask about database and hosting requirements
- Should propose technology recommendations

#### **Chat 4: Technology Stack Recommendation (Coordinator Agent)**

```
Based on your analysis, I think we should go with a modern web application. Here's what I'm thinking:

**Frontend:**
- Vue 3 with TypeScript for the user interface
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Modern, intuitive interface

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express for the API
- TypeScript for consistency
- RESTful API design

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Prisma ORM for database management

**Additional Requirements:**
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and security measures
