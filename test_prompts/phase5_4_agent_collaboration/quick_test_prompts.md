## üöÄ **Copy-Paste Test Prompts for Cursor Chat**

### **1. Basic System Health**
```
Check the system health and show me all available agents
```

### **2. Coordinator Communication**
```
Hello Coordinator! Can you tell me what agents you can work with and what they can do?
```

### **3. Multi-Agent Project Creation**
```
Coordinator, I want to create a new web application project. Can you help me:
1. Start a new project with the PDCA framework
2. Set up an agile workflow for it
3. Generate the initial project structure
4. Design a basic REST API for it
```

### **4. Agile + Project Generation**
```
Coordinator, I need to:
1. Create a new agile project called "E-commerce Platform"
2. Generate a Python FastAPI project structure for it
3. Create some user stories for the first sprint
```

### **5. Backend + Project Generation**
```
Coordinator, please help me:
1. Design a REST API for user management
2. Generate the Python FastAPI code for it
3. Create a database schema for users
4. Set up JWT authentication
```

### **6. Complex Workflow**
```
Coordinator, I want to build a complete microservices architecture:
1. Start a new agile project called "Microservices Platform"
2. Design the overall architecture (microservices pattern)
3. Generate separate projects for each service
4. Design APIs for each service
5. Set up security across all services
6. Create the first sprint with user stories

### **7. Agent Capabilities**
```
Coordinator, can you show me what each of your specialized agents can do? I want to understand their full capabilities.
```

### **8. Cross-Agent Data Sharing**
```
Coordinator, I created an API specification with the Backend Agent. Can you now use the Project Generation Agent to create the actual project files based on that specification?
```

### **9. Agile + Backend Integration**
```
Coordinator, I'm working on a sprint and need to:
1. Create user stories for API development
2. Design the API endpoints
3. Generate the code for those endpoints
4. Track the progress in the sprint
```

### **10. End-to-End Workflow**
```
Coordinator, let's do a complete project from start to finish:
1. Start a new agile project called "Full-Stack Dashboard"
2. Plan the first sprint with user stories
3. Design the backend API architecture
4. Generate the project structure
5. Create the database schemas
6. Implement authentication
7. Generate all the code
8. Show me the sprint progress
```

## üéØ **Testing Order:**
1. Start with prompts 1-2 (basic health check)
2. Move to prompts 3-4 (simple collaboration)
3. Test prompts 5-6 (medium complexity)
4. Finish with prompts 7-10 (advanced workflows)
