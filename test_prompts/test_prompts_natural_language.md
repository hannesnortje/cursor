## 📝 **Usage Instructions**

1. **Type** any of the natural language prompts above
2. **Send** the message in Cursor chat
3. **Observe** the response and system behavior
4. **Test** different variations and scenarios

---

## 🎯 **Testing Strategy**

### **Start Simple**
- Begin with basic system health checks
- Test one feature at a time
- Verify expected responses

### **Test Integration**
- Test features that depend on each other
- Verify data flows between components
- Check fallback mechanisms

### **Test Edge Cases**
- Test with invalid inputs
- Test when services are unavailable
- Test error handling

### **Performance Testing**
- Test with multiple concurrent requests
- Monitor response times
- Check resource usage

---

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

- **Qdrant Server**: Some features require a running Qdrant server
- **Redis Server**: Cross-chat features require Redis
- **Fallbacks**: System gracefully falls back to in-memory storage
- **Async Operations**: Some operations run in background threads
- **Error Handling**: System logs errors and continues operation

---

## 🔄 **Test Sequence Recommendation**

1. **System Health** → Verify basic functionality
2. **Basic Project** → Test core project management
3. **Vector Storage** → Test new Qdrant integration
4. **Cross-Chat** → Test communication system
5. **Agile Features** → Test specialized agents
6. **Project Generation** → Test template system
7. **Integration** → Test component interactions
8. **Error Scenarios** → Test robustness
