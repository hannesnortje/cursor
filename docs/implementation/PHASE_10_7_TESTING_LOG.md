## üéØ Test Execution Framework

### Initial Test Prompt for Cursor MCP

**PROMPT 1 - Initial Coordinator Contact**
```
I want to start a new project. Can you help me plan and execute this?
```

**Expected Coordinator Behavior:**

- Should NOT assume it's a Vue 3 TypeScript project
- Should gather requirements systematically

**What to Monitor:**
- [ ] Coordinator uses PDCA methodology
- [ ] Questions are relevant and progressive
- [ ] No assumptions made about technology stack
- [ ] Professional and helpful tone

## üîß Agent Creation Phase

### Expected Agent Creation
When coordinator has enough information, it should create:

**Required Agents:**
- [ ] **Agile/Scrum Agent**: For project management
- [ ] **Project Generation Agent**: For Vue 3 TypeScript setup
- [ ] **Backend Agent**: For API development (if needed)
- [ ] **UI Development Agent**: For frontend work

**Agent Creation Commands to Monitor:**
```bash
# Monitor in terminal for MCP tool usage:
create_agent
create_agile_project
start_workflow
create_group_chat
```

### Agent Status Verification

**Check Agent Creation:**
```
[Document which agents were created and their configurations]
```

**Dashboard Monitoring:**
- Navigate to http://localhost:5000
- Verify agents appear in dashboard
- Check agent status and activity

---

## ü§ù AutoGen Collaboration Phase

### Scrum Session Initiation
Once agents are created, monitor for:

**AutoGen Group Chat Creation:**
- [ ] Multi-agent conversation initiated
- [ ] Proper role assignment
- [ ] Structured brainstorming process
- [ ] PDCA methodology in action

**Conversation Flow:**
```
[Document the multi-agent brainstorming session]
```

### Brainstorming Results
**Specifications Developed:**
- [ ] Technical architecture decisions
- [ ] UI/UX approach
- [ ] Backend requirements
- [ ] Testing strategy
- [ ] Deployment plan

**Methodology Decisions:**
- [ ] Sprint structure
- [ ] Development workflow
- [ ] Code standards
- [ ] Review process

## üíª Development Phase

### Project Structure Creation
**Expected Deliverables:**
- [ ] Vue 3 + TypeScript project scaffolding
- [ ] Proper folder structure
- [ ] Configuration files (tsconfig, vite.config, etc.)
- [ ] Package.json with dependencies
- [ ] Initial component structure

### Code Generation Progress
**Frontend Development:**
- [ ] Vue 3 components created
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [ ] Routing setup (if applicable)
- [ ] State management (if needed)
- [ ] Styling approach implemented

**Backend Development:**
- [ ] API endpoints created
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Testing setup

## üé® UI Development Collaboration

### Direct Agent Interaction
When UI development begins, switch to direct conversation with UI agent:

**UI Agent Interaction Log:**

**PROMPT:**
```
[Direct communication with UI development agent]
```

**RESPONSE:**
```
[UI agent response and actions]
```

**Cursor Integration:**
- [ ] Code changes visible in VS Code
- [ ] Files created/modified appropriately
- [ ] TypeScript compilation working
- [ ] Vue 3 development server running
