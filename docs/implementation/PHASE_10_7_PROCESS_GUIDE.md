# Phase 10.7 - Vue 3 TypeScript Project: End-to-End AI Agent System Test

**Date:** September 10, 2025
**Branch:** `phase-10-7-typescript-project`
**Status:** üöÄ IN PROGRESS
**Test Type:** Production End-to-End AI Agent System Validation

---

## üéØ Test Objectives

This Phase 10.7 test validates the complete AI Agent System workflow by creating a real Vue 3 TypeScript production project through natural conversation with the Coordinator Agent, following PDCA methodology and Agile/Scrum practices.

### üé≠ Test Scenario Overview
1. **User** talks to **Coordinator Agent** to start a new project (no initial specs given)
2. **Coordinator** uses PDCA framework to gather requirements through conversation
3. **Coordinator** creates specialized agents (Agile, Project Generation, Backend, etc.)
4. **Agile Agent** initiates AutoGen scrum sessions for collaborative brainstorming
5. **Development process** follows Agile methodology with real code generation
6. **Dashboard monitoring** shows agent activity and collaboration
7. **Direct UI collaboration** between user and UI development agent
8. **Real development** happens in VS Code with Cursor integration

## üîÑ Process Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Coordinator Conversation (PDCA Plan Phase)
- **Who**: User ‚Üî Coordinator Agent
- **Goal**: Gather project requirements using PDCA methodology
- **Method**: Natural conversation, Coordinator asks probing questions
- **Output**: Complete project specification document

### Phase 2: Agent Creation & Delegation
- **Who**: Coordinator Agent
- **Goal**: Create necessary specialized agents for the project
- **Method**: Coordinator analyzes requirements and creates agents
- **Output**: Active agent ecosystem ready for collaboration

### Phase 3: Agile Scrum Initialization
- **Who**: Agile Agent + Created Agents (AutoGen session)
- **Goal**: Brainstorm specs and methodology collaboratively
- **Method**: AutoGen multi-agent conversation
- **Output**: Initial project methodology and detailed specifications

### Phase 4: Approval & Iteration Cycle
- **Who**: User ‚Üî Coordinator ‚Üî Agile Agent
- **Goal**: Refine specs through approval/feedback cycles
- **Method**: Present results ‚Üí Get feedback ‚Üí Iterate
- **Output**: Approved project specifications and development plan

### Phase 5: Development Sprint Execution
- **Who**: All Agents in Agile workflow
- **Goal**: Create actual Vue 3 TypeScript project code
- **Method**: Scrum sprints with real development tasks
- **Output**: Working Vue 3 TypeScript application

### Phase 6: Direct UI Collaboration
- **Who**: User ‚Üî UI Development Agent
- **Goal**: Real-time UI development and tweaking
- **Method**: Direct conversation with UI agent while monitoring in Cursor
- **Output**: Polished, production-ready UI
